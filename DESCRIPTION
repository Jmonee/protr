Title: Protein Sequence Feature Extraction with R
Description: The rdpi package aims for protein sequence feature extraction,
    which could be easily applied in Chemoinformatics, Bioinforamtics
    and Chemogenomics research. The descriptors listed in this package
    include Amino Acid Composition (Amino Acid Composition/Dipeptide
    Composition/Tripeptide Composition), Autocorrelation (Normalized
    Moreau-Broto Autocorrelation/Moran Autocorrelation/Geary
    Autocorrelation), CTD (Composition/Transition/Distribution),
    Conjoint Traid, Quasi-sequence Order (Sequence Order Coupling
    Number/Quasi-sequence Order Descriptors), and Pseudo Amino Acid
    Composition (Pseudo Amino Acid Composition/Amphiphilic Pseudo
    Amino Acid Composition). The package is developed by Computational
    Biology and Drug Design Group, Central South University.
