Title: R package for generating various numerical representation schemes of
    protein sequence
Description: The protr package focus on offering a unique and comprehensive
    toolkit for generating various numerical representation schemes of protein
    sequence. The descriptors included in the protr package are extensively
    utilized in bioinformatics and chemogenomics research. The commonly used
    descriptors listed in protr include amino acid composition,
    autocorrelation, CTD, conjoint traid, quasi-sequence order, pseudo amino
    acid composition, and profile-based descriptors derived by
    Position-Specific Scoring Matrix (PSSM). The descriptors for
    proteochemometric (PCM) modeling, includes the generalized scales-based
    descriptors derived by principal components analysis, factor analysis,
    multidimensional scaling, amino acid properties (AAindex), 20+ classes of
    2D and 3D molecular descriptors (Topological, WHIM, VHSE, etc.), and
    generalized BLOSUM/PAM matrix-derived descriptors. The protr package also
    integrates the function of parallelized similarity computation derived by
    pairwise protein sequence alignment and Gene Ontology (GO) semantic
    similarity measures. ProtrWeb, the web server built on protr, is located
