## Introduction

The protr package aims for protein sequence feature extraction, which could be applied in Bioinformatics and Chemogenomics research. The package is developed by Computational Biology and Drug Design Group, Central South University ([http://cbdd.csu.edu.cn/](http://cbdd.csu.edu.cn/) ).

## Package Features

### Commonly Used Descriptors

The commonly used protein sequence features listed in this package include:

  * Amino Acid Composition
  
    * Amino Acid Composition
    * Dipeptide Composition
    * Tripeptide Composition

  * Autocorrelation
  
    * Normalized Moreau-Broto Autocorrelation
    * Moran Autocorrelation
    * Geary Autocorrelation

  * CTD
  
    * Composition
    * Transition
    * Distribution

  * Conjoint Triad

  * Quasi-sequence-order Descriptors
  
    * Sequence-order-coupling Number
    * Quasi-sequence-order Descriptors
  
  * Pseudo Amino Acid Composition
  
    * Pseudo Amino Acid Composition
    * Amphiphilic Pseudo Amino Acid Composition

### Proteochemometric Modeling (PCM) Descriptors

Proteochemometric Modeling (PCM) descriptors listed in this package include:

  * Z-scales
  * T-scales
  * ST-scales
  * Vectors of Hydrophobic, Steric, and Electronic (VHSE)
  * MS-WHIM
  * Factor Analysis Scales of Generalized AA Information (FASGAI)
  * BLOSUM
  * Protein fingerprint (ProtFP)

### Sequence Alignment

Sequence alignment for protein sequences:

  * Needleman-Wunsch (global alignment)
  * Smith-Waterman (local alignment)

### GO Semantic Similarity

GO-terms semantic similarity measures:

  * Based on Entrez Gene ID
  * Similarity measures between protein sequences and between two groups of proteins (original similarity matrices, and three combination strategies: AvgTotal, AvgMax, MaxTotal)

### Miscellaneous Tools

  * Retrieving protein sequences from http://www.uniprot.org/
  
  * Loading protein sequences in FASTA format
  
  * Checking the protein sequences' amino acid types
  
  * Protein sequence segmentation
