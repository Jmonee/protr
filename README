# protr

## Introduction

The protr package aims for protein sequence feature extraction, which could be applied in Bioinformatics and Chemogenomics research. The package is developed by Computational Biology and Drug Design Group, Central South University ([http://cbdd.csu.edu.cn/](http://cbdd.csu.edu.cn/) ).

## Package Features

### Qualitative Descriptors

The commonly used qualitative protein sequence features implemented in protr include:

  * Amino Acid Composition
  
    * Amino Acid Composition
    * Dipeptide Composition
    * Tripeptide Composition

  * Autocorrelation
  
    * Normalized Moreau-Broto Autocorrelation
    * Moran Autocorrelation
    * Geary Autocorrelation

  * CTD
  
    * Composition
    * Transition
    * Distribution

  * Conjoint Triad

  * Quasi-sequence-order Descriptors
  
    * Sequence-order-coupling Number
    * Quasi-sequence-order Descriptors
  
  * Pseudo Amino Acid Composition
  
    * Pseudo Amino Acid Composition
    * Amphiphilic Pseudo Amino Acid Composition

### Quantitative Descriptors

The quantitative descriptors commonly used in Proteochemometric Modeling (PCM) implemented in protr include:

  * Generalized Scales-Based Descriptors derived by Principal Components Analysis

    * Generalized Scales-Based Descriptors derived by AA-Properties (AAindex)
    * Generalized Scales-Based Descriptors derived by 20+ classes of 2D and 3D Molecular Descriptors (Topological, WHIM, VHSE, etc.)

  * Generalized Scales-Based Descriptors derived by Factor Analysis

  * Generalized Scales-Based Descriptors derived by Multidimensional Scaling
  
  * Generalized BLOSUM Matrix-Derived Descriptors

  * Total 20+ Pre-computed 2D and 3D Descriptor Sets for the 20 Amino Acids to use with the Generalized Scales-Based Descriptors

### Parallelized Sequence Alignment Similarity Computation

Sequence alignment for protein sequences:

  * Needleman-Wunsch (global alignment)
  * Smith-Waterman (local alignment)

### Parallelized GO Semantic Similarity Computation

GO-terms semantic similarity measures:

  * Based on Entrez Gene ID
  * Similarity measures between protein sequences and between two groups of proteins (original similarity matrices, and three combination strategies: AvgTotal, AvgMax, MaxTotal)

### Miscellaneous Tools

  * Retrieve protein sequences from UniProt
  
  * Read protein sequences in FASTA format

  * Read protein sequences in PDB format
  
  * Sanity check for the amino acid types appeared in the protein sequences
  
  * Protein sequence segmentation

  * Auto Cross Covariance (ACC) for generating scales-based descriptors of the same length

## Web Interface

The web interface for protr, ProtrWeb, is located at:

http://cbdd.csu.edu.cn:8080/protrweb/

ProtrWeb does not require any knowledge of programming for the users, it is a user-friendly and one-click-to-go online platform for computing the protein features presented in the protr package.
